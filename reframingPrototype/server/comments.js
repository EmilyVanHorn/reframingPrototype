        text:       "Helping consumers to shape their understanding of e-waste is the first step to build awareness of the issue.  Your idea of providing a website for information on what materials go into electronics, what can be re-used and how to safely dismantle and properly recycle certain parts is brilliant! 1.    At the point of sale, electronic manufacturers/retailers should  ignite the conversation on the cause by supplying a link that comes with your receipt/ order number on how to re-use/recycle your old item.  One example would be partnering with existing platforms such as: www.earth911.com making E-Waste more visible.  Once consumers understand why recycling e-waste is important and how it impacts the environment, they will be more prompted to take action.  Here is key to facilitate to them the steps on how to recycle, where to drop off. 2.    One idea would be to have a zip code locator at the point-of-sale, where a couple of locations appear as an option to drop off their old electronic.  Also, some manufacturers/retailers or mobile providers are engaging consumers in the cause by offering them 'gift card' credits on new purchase or having a free mailing program available for the old items.  These types of programs should be incentivised or supported by governmental policies.  Finally, once the awareness and the steps on 'how-to' recycle are there, keeping the conversation going through social platforms and having the collaboration of celebrities by sharing their stories (as the\"Hall of Fame\"mentioned above) represent great examples to engage consumers and positively influence them. 3.   Sports and pop-culture figures have proved to be 'influencers or trendsetters' - one example is the active model and UN Goodwill Ambassador Gisele Bundchen, who lends her image and fame to several green related cause (http://blog.giselebundchen.com.br/en/geral/iniciativa-para-diminuir-o-efeito-estufa/).  These types of collaborations sparkle awareness, curiosity, call-to-action and keep conversations flowing on/off-line. "

        text:       "Rather than selling people *ready made* electronic devices, I think it would be fun to sell it to them in parts, so they are encouraged to put it together themselves.  Each part would be labelled (name, country of origin and composition) and good customer service groups would be put in place (to assist if need be).  By having people put together their own device, the idea of the 'black box' is removed AND they are more likely to go looking for parts if the device breakdown.  // with Ikea. "

        text:       "I agree that there is some confusion over the definition of e-waste (?WEEE) and many of the suggested solutions tend to reflect this. There is no lack of general information available on the nature, health and environmental impact of e-waste and indeed on many established procedures but, as you correctly point out it is limited in acceptance both in the general community and the manufacturing/distribution industry.  Your idea for a dismantling website was what I thought Cansu might be working towards in his Explode'em concept ( http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/explode-em/ ) or aspects of Kelly's DIY ( http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/build-a-diy-community-to-recycle-e-waste/ ) which also could be built on for relating stories of creative re-use.  Utilising packaging in creative ways would be a great option, perhaps if the parts map came in the form of a kid's game about recycling it would give marketing departments a new angle for on-the-shelf appeal of the packaging It could be printed on the inside although that would require dismantling part of the packaging.  I'm currently looking at the packaging for my Samsung cellphone. It came in two boxes - the inner box is the original black packaging for the general market which has been enclosed in a white box designed for the pre-paid market. Other possibilities spring to mind like word puzzles or Sudoku forming part of a competition which could be a feature of return use of the packaging as suggested in Adrian Franco's ( http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/send-old-cellphones-to-recycling-facilities-in-the-boxes-of-their-replacements/  ) concept.

A DIY project definitely has potential especially if the correct information is gathered like what is dangerous and how to disassemble the e-waste correctly, just like you mentioned.  A possible way to keep the information gathering sustainable would be to create a not for profit that could get sponsored money from big electronics producers. "

We especially liked your fresh take on incentivising certain purchase behaviors among consumers. As you've noted, this is a big idea! So, during this next phase, perhaps you'll work with the community to continue grounding it in reality by answering questions like: who would own and promote this buycycle system, and how would they fund it? What messaging or awareness campaigns might help consumers understand what this program is all about? Maybe there are even ways to prototype or further explore this (for instance, interviewing consumers to see if this is a system they'd consider using)? "

        text:       "Hannes I think this is a most thought provoking idea! Like you I'm not an economist so I don't know how this would affect prices. Logically your concept makes a lot of sense and would, I think, generate considerable recirculation of devices. It's a long time since I have thought about the intricacies of the retail process and what drives the release of new products. I wonder if we have Ideators in this challenge who are involved with selling the gamut of devices that will end up as e-waste to provide some input. Some of us have drawn on analogies in the automobile industry where product releases are in many instances similarly spaced. The housing market moves more slowly but like automobiles there is considerable residual value and useability in pre-owned houses. At the other end newspapers and periodicals have a very short life-cycle and are often of very low value once superceded. Perhaps we have some participants here who can bring background and experience to this concept, which deserves discussing fully. "

        text:       "Hi Paul, thanks a lot for your interesting thoughts. It's a great idea to look at comparable (and non-comparable!) 'product' markets for insights! That hadn't occurred to me at all. Since you brought up the automobile industry and the housing market, that made me realize a (maybe) crucial difference here: While with an old house, and even with an old car, people easily know that there is still some significant value in them, that doesn't seem to apply to cell phones for example. The pace of the market is so fast there that people indeed seem to treat their electronic devices very much like newspapers: If they do recycle them, then mostly because they think that they're not worth anything anymore. In the case of the newspapers that may be true, but not so much with electronic devices: It doesn't easily occur to us, that we should _not_ recycle them because they're not worth anything anymore, but _precisely_ because they are still worth _something_! Maybe not to you, maybe not to your neighbor, maybe not to anyone in your neighborhood, but very likely for someone out there who otherwise needs to buy a new or has to do without one.  With that in mind, two things would need to be done, I guess: a) raise awareness of the remaining value of old devices, and b) provide some market mechanism that directly or indirectly brings together sellers/donators and (re)buyers. Of course, many of all the great concepts here are already striving to do that.  An upside that I see with the 'buycycle' idea is that it introduces a new kind of 'give and take' principle at the very (temporal) moment in the market cycle, where a) people are already interacting with the market anyway, and where b) they can relatively easily be convinced of the usefulness of (the imposition of) the trade in / buycycling: Since they actively want something, they will be more likely to be okay with making a contribution to the society and the environment (as compared to other moments of trying to 'approach' and incentivize them).  Sorry for the slight digression... Your comment obviously inspired me to think further on all this... :)  Best, Hannes "

        text:       "Just a few comments (not thought through yet). I agree there is a need to raise awareness of residual value - both Robert Caruso's Deposit program ( http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/encourage-consumers-to-bring-back-electronics-with-a-deposit-program./ ) and Marie No's Green Deposit ( http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/hold-on-to-your-device-and-save-the-green-deposit-system-for-newly-purchased-electronics/ ) concepts create residual value, so they might be complementary to BuyCycle in some respects - going further the idea of a database accessed through website and app that monitors a residual value for each product, based on initial purchase makes this integration a possibility. I think the introduction of any of the concepts related to extending life requires a residual value and this will of course ultimately come from initial purchase price - balancing this would be not only preserved value in the secondary marketplace but also hopefully products that last their extended lifetime.

        text:       "Thanks Paul, again interesting thoughts  and I mostly agree with what you say. I think an important insight here could be the awareness of two different, although coincident, residual values: an individual one and a social/environmental one. It seems to me that many of us lose sight of the latter or even confuse the individual value ('individual' including friends and family here) with the overall residual value.  So I think this distinction, and/or circumstance, should definitely be something worth addressing in a potential awareness campaign. While I agree that some residual value will ultimately have to \"come\" (or be derived from) the initial purchase price on the level of economic incentive, I do think that residual value can also come from, or does exist, in other areas as well: precisely because individual and social/environmental value, although somewhat correlated, are not always necessarily identical.  The challenge is, I think, to make people see those hidden values, and act upon them of course. Especially when they have already decided to replace a device, then \"donating\" the social/environmental residual value doesn't even cost them anything really. "

I understand that this is only the start-up phase so my points are out of scope; however, I wanted to share them so you can keep them in mind during your refinement stage. If you can consider some of these point, then future growth may come more naturally as the boxes and number of chargers/cords grow:  -An electronic inventory system to keep track of the type of charger/cord. People can search by charger/code type or by the product that they are looking to find a cord/charger for (e.g. Galaxy S3 phone, the boxes may not contain any charger for the S3 but they have an S2, which can work). A few of these computers can be set-up around the area. (I know this is looking way down the line).  -The inventory list should also show the location (i.e. the box number)  In the mean time. I think looking into the design, structure, and organization of the box can be helpful before implementation.  -The optimal box shape and size should be determined through testing and specially designed to hang or organize all the cords/chargers to avoid tangling and to facilitate easy retrieval.  -It would be beneficial to have portal boxes so you can build them up when inventory increases or switch them around based on the environment or when inventory decreases.  Hope this helps! "

Given as one of your other concepts indicates - safety is important too - it might be necessary to have the donated items tested as working and electrically safe. There is currently a burgeoning industry in Australia around electrical safety and tagging - perhaps local testing organisations could be persuaded to test and tag for free (or notional fee). Your collection boxes for these items  would need to be like those you are designing for the Urbana cellphone/battery recycling project. You might then need to have a separate distribution point for the tested items sufficiently secure to prevent mixing of tested and untested items and allowing people to readily identify the suitability of recycled items for their purposes.. Given the litigious nature of modern society (especially in USA) I suspect some safety would be mandatory as in the absence of knowing where the items originated it might make either the stores or the service promoters liable for any injuries.

The testing equipment is not particularly expensive but here (in Australia) the actual testing has to be performed by a certified tester. The concept could be combined with Nerd Share, Hacker's Kitchens, your E-Cycle vehicles, Rewire.com groups, \"(e)waste not\" booths and the Hand Me Down Network, (all of them could incorporate suitable /designated individuals to undergo certification) - the digital data transfer and elimination service could similarly be combined with these 'locations' for service.

It could be something as simple as it's biodegradable or perhaps you can plant it.  To properly motivate manufacturers I think a diversified approach would work best.  Financial incentives help businesses in the immediate term.  Progressive and business friendly governments can help attract new business to their region by offering tax incentives for offering this kind of manufacturing.  In turn, the governments benefit from a larger tax base and lower unemployment.  I think these type of electronics would have major status appeal for both the manufacturer and the consumer.  The second part of the strategy would be to engage the entertainment industry (those that are pro-environment)  involved.  There is always the political route (regulation) but I'm not sure which would be quicker. "

I frequently travel to The Gambia and one thing I have learnt there is that if you can't open machines up, it's easy to understand how they can be repaired,  and you can't get replacement bits for broken parts that work, they quickly turn into obsolete junk. There you find donated computers in clinics that locals call 'ornaments', ultra sound machines that cost a fortune but don't work because one tiny part has broken and on the other hand you have cars that are 3 decades old but still run because they don't require software to be repaired and replacement parts don't have to be a perfect fit.  Could you maybe look at gadgets such as phones not necessarily to be modular but to be repairable. I think this would open it up a bit more. Maybe this means that components have to be modular but it might also mean that not just the outside (buttons, etc) follows a particular colour coding for usability but also that the inside is designed for usability that allows easy repair.
