        <p>In the following screens, your in person instructor will assign you a "version" of the study to complete and provide you with two sheets of paper, one titled "Your Ideas", and the other "New Framings". You will then be given a problem to solve. Within the 15 minute time limit, please write down as many ideas to solve the problem as you can on the "Your Ideas" sheet, as well as any new problem framings you come up with on the "New Framings" sheet. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">What do we mean by "framings"?</p>
        <p>A framing is just a new angle at which you look at a problem.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>For example, if the problem was:</p>
            <p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px">"How do we improve the public transporation experience?" </p>
            some of your reframings may be:
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing the number of buses on the road is a good idea, but may pose logistical issues. What are those logistical issues, and how might we get around them?</li>
                <li>Rather than add bus routes, how can we reinvent the ones we have to be more efficient?</li>
                <li>How can we integrate the bus and train system to work together cohesively?</li>
                <li>Maybe the problem isn't the transportation system, but the ease of access for commuters. How can we make it easier for people to get to their bus stops, train stations, and other transportation terminals?</li>
                <li>How can we raise more revenue to go towards public transit improvements?</li>

        <p>Challenge:</p>
        <h1>How can we manage e-waste and discard electronics to safeguard human health and protect our environment?</h1>

        <p>Ever wondered what happens to your outmoded cell phone when you replace it with the latest model? Or where a battery goes when you toss it in the trash? Around the world, end-of-life electronics that are waste, also known as e-waste, present a significant challenge for our environment and our health. Together with Brazilian bank Itaú Unibanco, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and OpenIDEO, we’re asking you to help us find ways to manage e-waste to better safeguard human health and protect our environment.</p>
        <p>According to the Consumer Electronics Association, in 2012 global spending on electronics is expected to surpass US$1 trillion 1. As use of these electronics increases around the world, the question of how to properly manage them when consumers are finished with them becomes more urgent. Unfortunately, not enough of our electronics are re-used, recycled or refurbished. Too many of them end up directly in landfills or recovered in an unsafe manner. According to the UN Environmental Programme, some 20 to 50 million metric tons of e-waste are generated worldwide every year, with mobile phones and televisions contributing 10 million tons per year by 2015 2.</p>
        <p>E-waste presents complex issues with many factors to consider, one of them being the environmental impact of hazardous substances and toxic chemicals – including lead, nickel, cadmium and mercury. The great news is that many of the materials used in consumer electronics can be recycled or refurbished to be used in other electronics. The opportunity is to find better ways to manage our used and end-of-life electronics and avoid them ending up in landfills.</p>
        <h2>Rio+20: A Global Stage</h2>
        <p>In June 2012 world leaders from government, the private sector, NGOs and other global institutions will join together in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development – an historic event to define new approaches for reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development. The event, Rio+20, will serve as the launching pad for our challenge and, we hope, will spark international conversation around the issues of technology, global connectedness and responsible use and reuse of consumer electronics.</p>
        <p>Together we can uncover and design solutions to better enable all of us to reuse or recycle our electronic gadgets and tech tools.</p>

        <h2>About Itaú Unibanco</h2>
        <p>In 2008, two of the leading banks in Brazil merged to create an even bigger and stronger bank, Itaú Unibanco Holding. Today, Itaú is the largest Latin American bank and one of the ten largest banks¹ on the planet, with over 104,000 employees and operations in 19 countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe. We believe that in order to sustain our business, we must also deliver long-lasting value to everyone involved. In 2011, Itaú's social and cultural investments added up to more than $156 million and in 2011 we were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the twelfth consecutive year.</p>

        <h3>THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</h3>
        <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an agency of the federal government of the United States charged with protecting human health and the environment, by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress. Proposed by President Richard Nixon, the EPA began operation on December 2, 1970. The Agency is currently led by Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, who was appointed by President Obama and approved by Congress. More than half of EPA employees are engineers, scientists, and environmental protection specialists; other groups include legal, public affairs, financial, and information technologists. These employees conduct environmental assessments, research, and education on environmental and human health issues. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle">Learn more.</a></p>
