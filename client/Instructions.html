    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>You have been recruited by a design firm called OpenIDEO to create design concepts for a design problem. Remember that, as a designer, you are free to explore alternative framings of the problem. If you are unfamiliar with the term "framing" refer to the example below.</p>
    <p>As in normal design practice, should you arrive at a different framing of the problem than what was given, assume that after the session ends, you have the opportunity to discuss this alternative framing with the client(s).</p>
    <p>When you are ready, click "Continue" to go to the problem brief.</p>
    
    <h1>What is Framing?</h1>
    <p>There are many ways to define the act of reframing a problem, but to put it simply, it is thinking up new ways to attack the problem you are trying to solve.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p>Problem:</p>
    <big>How can we save the physical bookstores from the internet?</big>
    <p>Some possible framings include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How can physical bookstores get customers in the door?</li>
        <li>What can physical bookstores provide that internet bookstores cannot?</li>
        <li>What do internet bookstores provide that physical ones are currently lacking, and how can physical bookstores provide those things?</li>
        <li>What are some things that physical bookstores can change to better compete financially?</li>
        <li>Should there even be separate physical and internet bookstores? Is there a way to combine the ideas or get rid of physical bookstores completely and integrate it into a different system?</li>
        
    </ul>

            <h2>Here are some of our answers!</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing the number of buses on the road is a good idea, but may pose logistical issues. What are those logistical issues, and how might we get around them?</li>
                <li>Rather than add bus routes, how can we reinvent the ones we have to be more efficient?</li>
                <li>How can we integrate the bus and train system to work together cohesively?</li>
                <li>Maybe the problem isn't the transportation system, but the ease of access for commuters. How can we make it easier for people to get to their bus stops, train stations, and other transportation terminals?</li>
                <li>How can we raise more revenue to go towards public transit improvements?</li>
            </ul>
