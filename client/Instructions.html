    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>You have been recruited by a design firm called OpenIDEO to create design concepts for a design problem. Remember that, as a designer, you are free to explore alternative framings of the problem. If you are unfamiliar with the term "framing" refer to the example below.</p>
    <p>As in normal design practice, should you arrive at a different framing of the problem than what was given, assume that after the session ends, you have the opportunity to discuss this alternative framing with the client(s).</p>
    <p>When you are ready, click "Continue" to go to the problem brief.</p>
    
    <h1>What is Framing?</h1>
    <p>There are many ways to define the act of reframing a problem, but to put it simply, it is thinking up new ways to attack the problem you are trying to solve.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p>Problem:</p>
    <big>How can we save the physical bookstores from the internet?</big>
    <p>Some possible framings include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How can physical bookstores get customers in the door?</li>
        <li>What can physical bookstores provide that internet bookstores cannot?</li>
        <li>What do internet bookstores provide that physical ones are currently lacking, and how can physical bookstores provide those things?</li>
        <li>What are some things that physical bookstores can change to better compete financially?</li>
        <li>Should there even be separate physical and internet bookstores? Is there a way to combine the ideas or get rid of physical bookstores completely and integrate it into a different system?</li>
        
    </ul>
