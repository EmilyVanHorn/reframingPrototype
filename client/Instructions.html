    <h1>Overview
</h1>
    <p>Welcome! Imagine you have been recruited by a design firm called OpenIDEO for help with a design problem. In this task, <u><b>your job is to create design solutions, and explore alternative framings for, the design problem</b></u>.
</p>

    <h1>More about solutions and framings</h1>
    <p>A design <u><b>solution</b></u> is a concrete proposal for how to solve a design problem, whereas a <u><b>framing</b></u> is a way of looking at a design problem (e.g., what the goal is, what constraints exist, what high-level approach might be valuable). Sometimes a reframing of the problem can change entirely what problem is being solved! Finding good solution(s) as well as framings for a problem are essential design skills.
</p>
    <p>For example, suppose you are trying to solve the following problem: </p>
    <h4 style="color:">How can we save physical bookstores from extinction in the age of online marketplaces for books and media?</h4>
    <p>Some <u><b>solutions</b></u> for the problem might include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Partner with local libraries to offer a variety of in-person
            enrichment activities, such as poetry readings and book club meetings</li>
        <li>Create “premium” memberships that enable exclusive early access to
            new books from one’s favorite authors and/or book signings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And some alternative <u><b>framings</b></u> of the problem might include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What do internet bookstores provide that physical ones are currently
            lacking, and how can physical bookstores provide those things?</li>
        <li>What are some things that physical bookstores can change to better compete financially?</li>
        <li>Should there even be separate physical and internet bookstores? Is
            there a way to combine the ideas or get rid of physical bookstores
            completely and integrate them into a different system?</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Now, if you’d like to get a bit more familiar with the idea of (re)framing a problem, try your luck at generating an alternative framing for the following problem (after you hit submit, you can see some framings that others had thought of):</p>

        <p><b>How might we improve the public transportation experience?</b></p>

        <form class="form-group">

            <input type="button" id="Submit" value="Submit" class="form-control" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#myAnswers"/>
        </form>

        <div id="myAnswers" class="collapse">
            <h2>Here are some interesting framings that others thought of:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing the number of buses on the road is a good idea,
                    but may pose logistical issues. What are those logistical issues, and how might we get around them?</li>
                <li>Rather than add bus routes, how can we reinvent the ones we have to be more efficient?</li>
                <li>Maybe the problem isn't the transportation system, but the
                    ease of access for commuters. How can we make it easier for
                    people to get to their bus stops, train stations, and other transportation terminals?</li>
            </ul>
