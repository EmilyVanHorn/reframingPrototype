    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Welcome! Imagine you have been recruited by a design firm called OpenIDEO 
        for help with a design problem. In this task, <u><b>your job is to create 
        design solutions, and explore alternative framings for, the design problem.</b></u>.
    </p>

    <h1>More about solutions and framings</h1>
    <p>A design <u><b>solution</b></u> is a concrete proposal for how to solve a design 
        problem, whereas a <u><b>framing</b></u> is a way of looking at a design problem 
        (e.g., what the goal is, what constraints exist, what high-level approach might 
        be valuable). Sometimes a reframing of the problem can change entirely what problem 
        is being solved! Finding good solution(s) as well as framings for a problem are 
        essential design skills.
    </p>
    
    <p>For example, suppose you are trying to solve the following problem: </p>
    <h4 style="color:">How can we save physical bookstores from extinction in the 
        age of online marketplaces for books and media?</h4>
    <p>Some <u><b>solutions</b></u> for the problem might include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Partner with local libraries to offer a variety of in-person
            enrichment activities, such as poetry readings and book club meetings</li>
        <li>Create “premium” memberships that enable exclusive early access to
            new books from one’s favorite authors and/or book signings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And some alternative <u><b>framings</b></u> of the problem might include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What do internet bookstores provide that physical ones are currently
            lacking, and how can physical bookstores provide those things?</li>
        <li>What are some things that physical bookstores can change to better compete financially?</li>
        <li>Should there even be separate physical and internet bookstores? Is
            there a way to combine the ideas or get rid of physical bookstores
            completely and integrate them into a different system?</li>
    </ul>

        </form>

        <div id="myAnswers" class="collapse">
            <p>Here are some interesting framings that others thought of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing the number of buses on the road is a good idea,
                    but may pose logistical issues. What are those logistical issues,
                    and how might we get around them?
                </li>
                <li>Rather than add bus routes, how can we reinvent the ones we have
                    to be more efficient?
                </li>
                <li>Maybe the problem isn't the transportation system, but the
                    ease of access for commuters. How can we make it easier for
                    people to get to their bus stops, train stations, and other 
                    transportation terminals?

    <h1>How can we manage e-waste and discard electronics to safeguard human
        health and protect our environment?
    </h1>

    <p>Ever wondered what happens to your outmoded cell phone when you replace
        it with the latest model? Or where a battery goes when you toss it in the
        trash? Around the world, end-of-life electronics that are waste, also
        known as e-waste, present a significant challenge for our environment and
        our health. Together with Brazilian bank Itaú Unibanco, the U.S. Department
        of State, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and OpenIDEO, we’re
        asking you to help us find ways to manage e-waste to better safeguard human
        health and protect our environment.
    </p>
    <p>According to the Consumer Electronics Association, in 2012 global spending on
        electronics is expected to surpass US$1 trillion 1. As use of these electronics
        increases around the world, the question of how to properly manage them when
        consumers are finished with them becomes more urgent. Unfortunately, not enough
        of our electronics are re-used, recycled or refurbished. Too many of them end
        up directly in landfills or recovered in an unsafe manner. According to the
        UN Environmental Programme, some 20 to 50 million metric tons of e-waste are
        generated worldwide every year, with mobile phones and televisions contributing
        10 million tons per year by 2015 2.
    </p>
    <p>E-waste presents complex issues with many factors to consider, one of them being
        the environmental impact of hazardous substances and toxic chemicals – including
        lead, nickel, cadmium and mercury. The great news is that many of the materials
        used in consumer electronics can be recycled or refurbished to be used in other 
        electronics. The opportunity is to find better ways to manage our used and 
        end-of-life electronics and avoid them ending up in landfills.

<template name="Rio">
    <p>In June 2012 world leaders from government, the private sector, NGOs and
        other global institutions will join together in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 
        for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development – an historic
        event to define new approaches for reducing poverty and promoting sustainable
        development. The event, Rio+20, will serve as the launching pad for our 
        challenge and, we hope, will spark international conversation around the 
        issues of technology, global connectedness and responsible use and reuse 
        of consumer electronics.
    </p>
    <p>Together we can uncover and design solutions to better enable all of us to
        reuse or recycle our electronic gadgets and tech tools.

<template name="Uibanco">
    <p>In 2008, two of the leading banks in Brazil merged to create an even 
        bigger and stronger bank, Itaú Unibanco Holding. Today, Itaú is the 
        largest Latin American bank and one of the ten largest banks¹ on the 
        planet, with over 104,000 employees and operations in 19 countries 
        throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe. We believe that in order to
        sustain our business, we must also deliver long-lasting value to everyone 
        involved. In 2011, Itaú's social and cultural investments added up to 
        more than $156 million and in 2011 we were included in the Dow Jones 
        Sustainability Index for the twelfth consecutive year.
