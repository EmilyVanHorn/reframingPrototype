    <h1>More about solutions and framings</h1>
    <p>A design <u><b>solution</b></u> is a concrete proposal for how to solve a design problem, whereas a <u><b>framing</b></u> is a way of looking at a design problem (e.g., what the goal is, what constraints exist, what high-level approach might be valuable). Sometimes a reframing of the problem can change entirely what problem is being solved! Finding good solution(s) as well as framings for a problem are essential design skills.
</p>
    <p>For example, suppose you are trying to solve the following problem: </p>
    <h4 style="color:">How can we save physical bookstores from extinction in the age of online marketplaces for books and media?</h4>
    <p>Some <u><b>solutions</b></u> for the problem might include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Partner with local libraries to offer a variety of in-person
            enrichment activities, such as poetry readings and book club meetings</li>
        <li>Create “premium” memberships that enable exclusive early access to
            new books from one’s favorite authors and/or book signings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And some alternative <u><b>framings</b></u> of the problem might include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What do internet bookstores provide that physical ones are currently
            lacking, and how can physical bookstores provide those things?</li>
        <li>What are some things that physical bookstores can change to better compete financially?</li>
        <li>Should there even be separate physical and internet bookstores? Is
            there a way to combine the ideas or get rid of physical bookstores
            completely and integrate them into a different system?</li>
    </ul>
