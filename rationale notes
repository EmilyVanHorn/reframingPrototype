IDEA: Bringing transparency to the people
RATIONALE: 
    -make people understand
    -dismantle and reuse safely
    -online community
    - info on the packaging
    -BETTER EDUCATE CUSTOMERS
    
    The most important action we could take in helping to manage e-waste is to make people care. People don't care because they don't understand that it's such a problem, or they don't know how they could recycle their electronics or even that they are currently doing it wrong. Spread the word for fun and convenient recycling tricks and e-waste will be a thing of the past.
    
IDEA: connecting users
RATIONALE:
    One man's trash is another man's treasure. We've all heard the saying, yet when we're hauling our tumbleweed of cables from our old dusty entertainment system to make room for our sleek and shiny new one, we rarely think of what a treasure it could be. Meanwhile, the kid down the street is scraping together his cash for a new speaker system for his room just like the one that is currently on its way to the dumpster. 
    
IDEA: diy community
RATIONALE:
    Tinkerers, fiddlers, and do-it-yourself-ers. We all know one, you might even be one; but when it comes to electronics, it's not always as easy as finding a screwdriver and going at it. Handling electronics parts could be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, not to mention inconvenient with all the different proprietary equipment out there, but with a supportive community to help you out and share tools and parts, it's easy.
    
IDEA: buycycle
RATIONALE:
    -force people to recycle
    -incentives: get new devices
    -punishment: can only get used devices
    
    All of the recycling programs and incentives in the world will not force the laziest of the lazy nor the hoarder royalty to do anything useful with their old electronics. Most of those devices will end up in the trash or at the bottom of a desk drawer somewhere. What will get them moving is telling them that they cannot get their new devices without getting rid of their old ones first. It's not an incentive or a deterrent. It's the law.
